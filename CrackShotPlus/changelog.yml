Fixed attribute issue in 1.16
Found out that CrackShot weapon identification doesn't work properly anymore
  Perhaps something to do with hex colors
  Anyway these will NOT work as Item_Name "&7&eAK-12 &7[&eAuto&7]" and Item_Name "&7AK-12 &7[&eAuto&7]&8"
  While this WILL work Item_Name "&7AK-12 &7[&eAuto&7]"
  Basically having more than 1 color symbols in row will break weapon and if you have color symbol at end of weapon name will also break it
